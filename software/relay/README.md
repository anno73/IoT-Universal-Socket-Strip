# Supporting Stuff

## Digistump Digispark USB Dev

### Platformio tweaks

#### Switch the platform package

I have encountered some issues with the Digistump avr package. There is missing EEPROM.h library. To resolve this I copied the original library from the arduino avr package to .platformio/packages/framework-avr-digistump/libraries package.
There is also a lot of unnecessary noise during compilation because of moved header file locations, redefinition of #define BIN and other stuff.
In addition EEPROMWearLevel library did not compile. 
This was the final reason for me to try a different core package.
In the end I overwrote core and variant from [Digispark USB](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/atmelavr/digispark-tiny.html#board-atmelavr-digispark-tiny) package to tiny and tinyx5 as it is used by the [generic ATTiny85](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/atmelavr/attiny85.html#board-atmelavr-attiny85) definitions (see [attiny85.json](https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelavr/blob/master/boards/attiny85.json)). Keeping the rest as it is, allowed me to program regularly via USB. See [platformio.ini](platformio.ini).

There is a new actively maintained ATTiny85 core available on https://github.com/ArminJo/DigistumpArduino which gives smaller code, has active development, and more stock libraries. I use this now for further development.

#### Include (missing) libs as submodules

As I did not find [SendOnlySoftwareSerial](https://github.com/nickgammon/SendOnlySoftwareSerial) and a current version of [Streaming](https://github.com/janelia-arduino/Streaming) in PlatformIO's library repository, I added these as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in the library folder.
See [github blog](https://github.blog/) for more information on [how to work with submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/).
Especially on initial cloning you might need to use `git clone --recursive <project url>`. If you already have cloned the repository and only miss the submodules, `git submodule update --init --recursive` should do the trick.

### IIC

[SoftI2CMaster](https://github.com/felias-fogg/SoftI2CMaster) provides [I2CShell](https://github.com/felias-fogg/SoftI2CMaster/tree/master/examples/I2CShell) as an example, which is a nice I2C command sending tool for Arduino.
