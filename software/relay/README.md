Does each device need to remember configuration or should it get updated by host on power up?

# Supporting Stuff

## Digistump Digispark USB Dev

### Platformio tweaks

I have encountered some issues with the Digistump avr package. There is missing EEPROM.h library. To resolve this I copied the original library from the arduino avr package to .platformio/packages/framework-avr-digistump/libraries package.
There is also a lot of unnecessary noise during compilation because of moved header file locations, redefinition of #define BIN and other stuff. 
In the end I overwrote core and variant to tiny and tinyx5 as it is used by the generic ATTiny85 definitions. Keeping the rest as it is, allowed me to program regularly via USB.

## Level shifter

?? Use I2C against 5V rail? ESP8266 is 5V tolerant.

As it seems, a 5V powered ATTiny85 does not recognize 3.3V levels on I2C. So a level shifter needs to be used to convert to 5V levels as used by the ATTiny.
